  Comprehensive PR review using specialized agents. Use when the user asks to
  "review this PR", "check my PR", "review code quality", "run PR review",
  "analyze this pull request", or invokes /review-pr. Launches targeted review
  agents for code quality, error handling, test coverage, type design, comments,
  security, API compatibility, spec compliance, and code simplification.

# Comprehensive PR Review

Orchestrate specialized review agents against a PR's changes. Each agent
runs as an independent Task with its own system prompt, tools, and
isolation. Results are aggregated into a prioritized action plan.

## Review Aspects

| Aspect | Agent | Focus |
|--------|-------|-------|
| `code` | code-reviewer | Project guidelines, bugs, CLAUDE.md compliance |
| `errors` | silent-failure-hunter | Silent failures, catch blocks, error logging |
| `tests` | pr-test-analyzer | Test coverage quality, critical gaps |
| `types` | type-design-analyzer | Type encapsulation, invariants |
| `comments` | comment-analyzer | Comment accuracy, documentation rot |
| `security` | security-auditor | OWASP, secrets, auth, injection, IaC perms |
| `api` | api-contract-checker | Breaking changes, backward compat, schemas |
| `spec` | spec-compliance | Design doc/ADR/requirements alignment |
| `simplify` | code-simplifier | Clarity, redundancy, maintainability |

Default: `all` (run every applicable aspect).

## Workflow

### 1. Parse Input

Extract from `$ARGUMENTS`:

- **First token**: PR number (required).
- **Remaining tokens**: Requested aspects. If blank or `all`, run all applicable.

### 2. Check for Existing Review

```bash
bd list --label "pr-review,pr:<number>" --json
```

- **No bead found**: This is a first review (turn 1).
- **Bead found**: This is turn N+1. Read the existing bead ID and
  increment the turn label.

### 3. Gather PR Context

```bash
gh pr diff <number>
gh pr view <number> --json title,body
```

Optionally fetch GitHub review comments for supplementary context:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<number>/comments
```

### 4. Select Applicable Agents

| Condition | Agents |
|-----------|--------|
| Always | `code`, `security` |
| Test files changed OR `tests` requested | `tests` |
| Error handling changed OR `errors` requested | `errors` |
| Comments/docstrings added OR `comments` requested | `comments` |
| Types added/modified OR `types` requested | `types` |
| Public interfaces changed OR `api` requested | `api` |
| Spec/design docs exist OR `spec` requested | `spec` |
| After other reviews OR `simplify` requested | `simplify` |

When `all` is requested, run every agent regardless of file heuristics.

### 5. Model Escalation

Default: `sonnet`. Escalate to `opus` only when:

- The task is vague or under-specified with no clear precedent
- Novel architectural reasoning is required
- Crypto protocol design or complex threat modeling

| Agent | Default | Escalate to opus when |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| code-reviewer | sonnet | Large diff (300+ lines) AND security code |
| silent-failure-hunter | sonnet | Complex error flows across many modules |
| pr-test-analyzer | sonnet | Rarely |
| type-design-analyzer | sonnet | Novel/ambiguous type design, no precedent |
| comment-analyzer | sonnet | Rarely |
| security-auditor | sonnet | Crypto, auth protocol, threat modeling |
| api-contract-checker | sonnet | Rarely |
| spec-compliance | sonnet | Vague spec with significant arch changes |
| code-simplifier | sonnet | Rarely |

### 6. Create or Reuse Parent Bead

**First review**: Create the PR review parent epic bead:

```bash
bd create "Review: PR #<number> — <title>" \
  --type epic \
  --labels "pr-review,pr:<number>,turn:1" \
  --external-ref "https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/pull/<number>" \
  --description "<PR body summary>" \
  --silent
```

**Re-review**: Use the existing bead ID and increment the turn label.

### 7. Launch Review Agents

Use the Task tool to dispatch each selected agent. Agents have their
own system prompts and tool definitions — do NOT construct inline
prompts or read reference files.

Each Task call:

- `subagent_type`: the agent name (e.g., `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`)
- `model`: `sonnet` or `opus` per step 5
- `prompt`: Include the PR diff, plus these variables:
  `PARENT_BEAD_ID`, `TURN`, `PR_URL`, `ASPECT`

**Batching**: Launch at most 3 concurrent Task calls per message.
Run `security` + `code` in the first batch. Wait for each batch to
complete before launching the next.

**Sequential mode**: When a single aspect is requested, launch one
agent at a time for interactive review.

### 8. Aggregate Findings

```bash
bd list --parent <parent-bead-id> --status open --json
```

Group findings by their `severity:*` label.

### 9. Present Summary

```markdown
## Critical Issues (must fix before merge)

- [aspect]: description [location]

## Important Issues (should fix)

- [aspect]: description [location]

## Suggestions (nice to have)

- [aspect]: description [location]

## Strengths

- [aspect]: description
```

### 10. Offer to Post

Ask the user whether to post findings as a PR comment. **Do NOT post
without explicit confirmation.**

If confirmed, write to a temp file and post:

```bash
gh pr comment <number> --body-file /tmp/pr-review-comment.md
```

Comment template:

````markdown
<!-- pr-review:<bead-id> -->
## <bead-id> — PR Review

N critical · N important · N suggestions

---

### Critical

**Finding title** `<finding-bead-id>`
Summary (2-3 lines max per finding).

### Important

**Finding title** `<finding-bead-id>`
Summary.

### Suggestions

**Finding title** `<finding-bead-id>`
